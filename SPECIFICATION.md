# Specification - AI Booking System for Hospitals

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Title:** AI Booking System for Hospitals
- **Domain:** Healthcare (Hospital Management System)
- **Problem Statement:**  
  The AI Booking System for Hospitals is designed to streamline appointment scheduling in healthcare facilities. The system will utilize AI to optimize appointment booking, reduce waiting times, and improve patient satisfaction. It will also allow patients to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments and provide reminders, while integrating with the hospital's existing management systems.
- **Individual Scope:**  
  This system will provide an easy-to-use interface for patients to book and manage appointments with doctors. It will be integrated with a backend AI system that ensures efficient scheduling based on availability and urgency. The system will also feature real-time notifications and a patient management dashboard for staff to view and manage appointments.

## 2. Detailed Requirements

### 2.1 User Roles:
- **Patients:** Can book, cancel, or reschedule appointments.
- **Doctors:** Can view their schedules and update availability.
- **Hospital Staff/Administrators:** Can manage patient records, appointments, and doctor schedules.

### 2.2 Functional Requirements:
- **AI Scheduling:** The AI will automatically suggest available time slots based on the doctor’s availability, patient preferences, and urgency.
- **Booking Interface:** Patients will have an easy-to-use form to select a department, doctor, and available time.
- **Appointment Management:** Patients can view upcoming appointments and reschedule or cancel them as needed.
- **Notifications:** Automated email/SMS notifications will be sent for appointment confirmations, reminders, and changes.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Hospital staff can view and manage all bookings, patients, and doctors in a central dashboard.

### 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Scalability:** The system must handle a large number of patients and doctors.
- **Security:** Patient data must be encrypted, and only authorized staff should access sensitive information.
- **Availability:** The system should be highly available with minimal downtime, especially during peak hours.
- **Performance:** Fast response times for both booking requests and management interfaces.

## 3. Feasibility Justification
The project is feasible as it addresses a common problem in healthcare systems—inefficient appointment scheduling. The use of AI ensures that the system can handle a large volume of appointments, which will lead to optimized doctor schedules and better patient outcomes. The system’s requirements are realistic, and the technology stack (e.g., React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, AI scheduling algorithms) is achievable within the given timeline. Additionally, the system will integrate with existing hospital management systems for a smooth transition and operation.
